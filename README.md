# Horiseon Accessibility Refractor 

## Accessibility is Important! 

Horiseon is a marketing agency, which specializes in making their clients web presence more meaningful and productive. They specialize in social media presence, search engine optimization, and online reputations. Horiseon has expressed interest in making their website more accessible and easy to use for those with disabilities. On the backend, they would like a more organized and purposeful code so that any future developers will have an easy transition in working with their website. Horiseon knows the importance of SEOs and how important user experience on a website can be. Horiseon also finds it important to protect themselves from any potential litigation from lack of accesibility.

It was my job to "refract" the code to meet common accessibility standards such as: 
<br>
	- alt attributes 
<br>
	- header attributes that accurately describe the content of the webpage to assist with search engine optimization 
<br>
	- a descriptive title
<br>
<br>
While "refracting" the code, I was also tasked with making the code more organized, easy to understand and accessible to anyone who may be working on this project in the future. I did this by: 
<br>
	- updating all of elements to be more nuanced and specific 
	<br>
	- consolidating duplicate CSS values 
	<br>
	-added comments to the HTML and CSS documents to further organize the content and make it easier to understand
	<br>
	<br>

I am working on this project because I believe that everyone should have equal access to the internet. 
If someone is differently abled, it does not mean that they shouldn't be able to enjoy the internet in a meaningful and engaging way. 
Improving the accessibility of this website will make it available to a portion of the population that it was not available to before.

## Installation

There is no installation required. All files must remain in the position in which they are saved to ensure that all links, styles and photos function properly. 

Below are examples of the links for the CSS style sheet and the images used in this webpage.

## Usage 

In the gif included below, I have demonstrated how all of the bookmarks work. When the links in the navigation bar are clicked, they will jump to the corresponding section in the webpage.
