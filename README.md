# Horiseon Accessibility Refractor 

## Description 

WHAT: Horiseon is a marketing agency. They have expressed interest in making their website more accessible and easy to use for those with disabilities.
WHY: Horiseon would like their website to be optomized for search engines and easy to use for people with disabilities. 
HOW: Refract the code to meet accessibility standards such as: 
	-alt attributes 
	-header attributes that accurately describe the content of the webpage to assist with search engine optimization 
	-a descriptive title
Why am I working on this project? 
I am working on this project because I believe that everyone should have equal access to the internet. 
Just because someone has a disability, it does not mean that they shouldn't be able to enjoy the internet in a less meaningful and engaging way. 
Improving the accessibility of this website will make it available to a portion of the population that it was not available to before.

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.


## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
